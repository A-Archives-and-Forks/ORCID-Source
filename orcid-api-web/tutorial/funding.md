# Write, update and delete funding items

These calls can be used with Member API credentials on sandbox or the production servers.

## Permission to edit the record
Editing the funding section of a record requires a 3 step OAuth token with the ```/activities/update``` scope, the ```/read-limited``` scope should also be requested for reading funding items. See [Authentciating using OAuth](https://github.com/ORCID/ORCID-Source/blob/master/orcid-api-web/README.md#authenticating-users-and-using-oauth--openid-connect) for steps to obtain a token.
