email.july_2018.subject=Making the most of your ORCID iD!
email.july_2018.paragraph.1.1=In early July, we passed a big milestone - we issued our 5,000,000th ORCID iD! As one of those 5m+ users yourself, you're in good company. Researchers from all around the world have signed up for an iD, including well-known figures* like Nobel Laureate

email.july_2018.paragraph.2.1=Registering for your iD is just the first step. To fully benefit from ORCID, you need to use your iD. At ORCID we talk a lot about the  
email.july_2018.paragraph.2.url.text=trusted connections
email.july_2018.paragraph.2.url.link=https://orcid.org/blog/2017/02/20/whats-so-special-about-signing
email.july_2018.paragraph.2.2=you can make between yourself and your professional activities and affiliations. At the moment, only about 40% of ORCID users are making those connections. Congratulations if you are already using your iD, and giving organizations like your university, your publisher, or your funder permission to add information to your ORCID record.

email.july_2018.paragraph.3.1.url.link=https://orcid.org/blog/2015/07/23/six-things-do-now-you%E2%80%99ve-got-orcid-id
email.july_2018.paragraph.3.2=. It's very easy: just sign into your ORCID account when an organization asks you to connect your iD and give them permission to update your record. For example, a journal can add information about your authored publications or your researcher institution can add information about your employment. You can also easily add information yourself, using one of our handy

Distinguish yourself - and be in control of how your work is represented - by using your ORCID iD!

email.march_2019.subject=Add a backup email to your ORCID account!
email.march_2019.paragraph_1=The number one reason why ORCID users contact us is because they’re unable to access their ORCID record -- and the number one reason why, is because they only have one email address connected with their account, and they’ve lost access to it.
email.march_2019.paragraph_2=Make sure this doesn’t happen to you - add one or more backup emails to your account now! It only takes a couple of minutes, and will ensure that, even if you move organizations, you can still access your account and, if needed, easily reset your password (another top reason why users contact us).
email.march_2019.paragraph_3.part_1=Simply
email.march_2019.paragraph_3.part_2=sign in to your ORCID account
email.march_2019.paragraph_3.part_3=and click on the Account Settings link at the top of the page. Then select the edit option for Email and notification preferences, type your backup email in the Add Another Email box, and click the Add button. That’s it - you’re done! See
email.march_2019.paragraph_3.part_4=Account email addresses
email.march_2019.paragraph_3.part_5=for more information.
email.march_2019.paragraph_4.part_1=If you haven’t already done so, we strongly recommend that you add your personal email to your ORCID account because -- unlike a work email --  it’s unlikely that you will lose access to this.  The default visibility setting for emails is private (Only Me), meaning that ORCID will not share this information with other parties.  You can use your
email.march_2019.paragraph_4.part_2=Visibility preferences
