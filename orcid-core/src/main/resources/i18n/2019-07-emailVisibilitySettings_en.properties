email.2019.vis_settings.when_we_first_launched=When we first launched ORCID, the default setting was that none of your ORCID record information was shared.

You may adjust your sharing settings at any time through your

email.2019.vis_settings.we_are_contacting_you_to_thank=We are contacting you to thank you for registering for an ORCID iD, and to invite you to reconsider your visibility settings, which are all currently set to Only me (private).  There are significant benefits to sharing your ORCID record information, including re-use of information to fill grant application webforms, manuscript submission webforms, and faculty profile webforms.  Re-sharing information can save you substantial time and also incentivize more of the organizations you interact with to build functionality in their systems to re-use your ORCID record information (with your permission, of course).
email.2019.vis_settings.changing_who_you_share=Changing who you share your information with is quick and easy. Simply sign in to your ORCID account, navigate to your Account Settings, and select the visibility setting you prefer. You can do this for each item in your record individually or in bulk (for also known as names, keywords, websites, other IDs, and works).
