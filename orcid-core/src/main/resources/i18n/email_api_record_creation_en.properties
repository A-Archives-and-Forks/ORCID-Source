# Launched in October 2012, the ORCID Registry contains unique identifiers (ORCID iDs)
# for researchers and scholars. In addition, the Registry enables you to designate
# "Trusted Organizations" with which you can exchange information. Many publishers and
# granting agencies have started to ask for ORCID iDs with submissions to better link
# researchers with their research activities. ORCID iD holders control what is in
# their Records and who can see this information. Learn more about ORCID at
# http://testserver.orcid.org.
