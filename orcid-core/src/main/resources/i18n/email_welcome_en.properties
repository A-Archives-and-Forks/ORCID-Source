#Funders, publishers, universities and others use the information contained in an ORCID Record to help decrease the record keeping they ask from you. Increase the amount of information you can share in this way by adding other names you are known by, professional information, funding items you have received and works you have created to your Record.

#
#2. Continue to use your ORCID iD
